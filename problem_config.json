    "description": "The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem. Given n facilities and n locations, with a distance matrix A (between locations) and a flow matrix B (between facilities), the goal is to assign each facility to a unique location so as to minimize the total cost defined as the sum of products A[i][j] * B[p[i]][p[j]].",
